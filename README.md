# ASSESSMENT-4
Creating a smart contract with 2 or 3 functions and integrating it with the frontend.

# Description
We will be building a smart contract with some functions and will be integrating with the frontend part. So we can make the changes required with the help of the icons present in the frontend application so that it will be connected with the backend(meta mask wallet). The basic idea is that in the frontend we will be importing the Web3 and establish a connection with the Etherium network. For this project we will install some extra softwares like Node js and Metamask. Node js is a javascript runtime environment and library for running the web applications. Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the etherium blockchain. The main thing to etablish a connection with the frontend is that Contract address and the ABI (application binary interface). We added some extra function that is calculator, it performs operations like addition, subtraction and multiplication.


# Getting started

Features of the frontend application:
1. Deposit ETH into the atm
2. Withdraw ETH from the atm
3. Add the two values A and B
4. Subtract the two values from A and B
5. Multiply the two values A and B


Customization

You can customize the UI elements, styles, and behavior of the Crypto ATM component according to your project's requirements. Modify the JSX structure, CSS styles, and event handlers to align with your application's design and functionality.


# Setup
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
Open two additional terminals in your VS code
In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
